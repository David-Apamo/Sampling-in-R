# Sampling-in-R
This repository provides an in-depth exploration of four fundamental sampling methods used in statistics: Simple Random Sampling, Stratified Sampling, Systematic Sampling and Cluster Sampling. The aim is to understand the principles behind each method, how to implement them in R, and their practical applications.
